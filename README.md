# noiserender
made for a badapple video, which renders videos with noise and is pretty fast i'd say

setup instructions : 
1. copy over the thingy i gave in comments into any file but with .py at end
2. make sure you have ffmpeg, if you have no idea what it is, then run "winget install ffmpeg" idk about other os's you should know about it if you use other os's
3. run the thingy with "python {filename}.py" (replace file name with filename)
4. download any video somewhere idk look it up, then open it in the app and the rest should be easy
5. don't panic during the stitch stage since it takes about like 2 mins
